This is a work in progress toy interpreter for a FORTH-alike
programming language, developed during my YouTube C coding course [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HjXBXBgfKyk&list=PLrEMgOSrS_3cFJpM2gdw8EGFyRBZOyAKY)

The interpreter will be finished in the next lessons. Please refer to the YouTube videos for more information.

IMPORTANT: you can also watch the videos in English languages:

1. The videos have a English auto dubbed audio track.
2. The Italian subtitles are hand-cleaned and automatically translated English subtitles work great.
